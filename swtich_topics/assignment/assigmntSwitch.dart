// Swtich Assignment:

// Write a Dart program that takes two numbers and an operator (+, -, *, /) from the user and performs the operation using switch.

// 2: Ask the user to enter a number from 1 to 7, and use switch to print the corresponding day name (e.g., 1 = Monday). 

// 3: Take a character grade (A, B, C, D, F) from the user and use switch to print a message like “Excellent”, “Good”, “Average”, etc.

// 4: Ask the user to input a color name (red, yellow, green) and use switch to display the action (e.g., stop, wait, go).

// 5: Show a menu with 3–4 items, ask the user to select a number, and use switch to print the price and item name.

// 6: Ask the user to input a number (1–12). Use switch to print the month name and number of days (assume non-leap year).

// 7: Ask the user to enter a single alphabet character. Use switch to check if it is a vowel or consonant.

// 8: Ask the user to enter their role (admin, moderator, user) and use switch to print different messages for each.
